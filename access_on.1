.SH NAME
access_on, access_off \- allow or prevent remote
connections to workstations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/athena/bin/access_on
.br
.B /usr/athena/bin/access_off
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I access_on
and
.I access_off
utilities control remote connections to Athena workstations.
When you activate and login to a workstation,
the workstation's
.I toehold
process uses the
.I access_off
program to prevent the workstation's
.I inetd
daemon from accepting
network remote connections.
In other words,
no one can access the workstation with commands
like
.I rlogin,
.I rcp,
.I ftp,
and
.I telnet.
This protects the user from unexpected and possibly hostile remote connections.

Of course the user may wish to allow remote connections.
The
.I access_on
command performs this function.
Use
.I access_off
to prevent connections again.

Note that the
.I toehold
utility manipulates remote access at activation and
deactivation time.

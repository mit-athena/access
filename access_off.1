.TH ACCESS_OFF 1 "29 December 1996"
.SH NAME
access_on, access_off \- allow or prevent remote connections to workstations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B access_on
.br
.B access_off
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I access_on
and
.I access_off
utilities control remote connections to Athena workstations.
The workstation's
.I reactivate
process uses the
.I access_off
program to prevent the workstation's
.I inetd
daemon from accepting network remote connections.  In other words, no
one can access the workstation with commands like
.IR rlogin ,
.IR rcp ,
.IR ftp ,
and
.IR telnet .
This protects the user from unexpected and possibly hostile remote connections.
.PP
Of course the user may wish to allow remote connections.
The
.I access_on
command performs this function.
Use
.I access_off
to prevent connections again.
